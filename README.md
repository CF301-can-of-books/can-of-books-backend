# Team Agreement
## Logistical
**What hours will you be available to communicate?**\
1p - 5p, 6:30p - 9p

**What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**\
Discord, Slack

**How often will you take breaks?**\
Approx every 1.5 hours

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**\
We'll have to skip what isn't in MVP, or ask TAs for help.

## Cooperative
**Make a list of each person’s strengths.**\
- Joe - makes JS easy to understand
- Stef - is good at executing JS on others' ideas, also enjoys CSS
- Haustin - has the patience of a Shaolin monk

**How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?**\
We rotate driver/navigator, and we all get to learn things.

**In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?**\
- Joe - Wants to learn front-end design concepts
- Stef - Be a JS whiz
- Haustin - Back-end, mongoDB and other DBs

**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?**\
We're going to show up, support each other's learning, ask questions when we don't understand, and take the time to explain if we do.

## Conflict Resolution
**What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?**\
We plan to rotate driver and navigator between the three of us and we won't have that problem.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?**\
We plan to rotate driver and navigator between the three of us and we won't have that problem.

**How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**\
We have an agreement that there are no stupid questions, and that if we do need to take a step back to ensure everyone understands what's going on, we will do so.
